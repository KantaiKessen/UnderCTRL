# Everything is Under CTRL

No really. It's under control.
## Getting Started
Download the repo to your computer through git or github.

### Prerequisites
If you are downloading through git, you will need git. You also need to have Ubuntu.

```
git clone https://github.com/Niokiryth/UnderCTRL.git
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Run the first script

```
sudo ./starterscript.sh
```

Make a text file with the users that are supposed to be in your system and one with the programs

```
vim ./users
vim ./programs
```
Run the second script
```
sudo ./basicscript.sh
```
Make sure you check your sudoers file
```
sudo visudo
```
Run the third script
```
sudo ./ubuntu(version)/replace.sh
```
Be wary, because this could break your system.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
